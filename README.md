# Photography API

This project was designed to create a "smooth scroll" experience for users browsing photographs. 
I created this site with help from the Unsplash API.

I made this using Javascript ascyn/await and fetch methods. 

**This API is limited to 40 requests per hour. If the site does not load, please retry later.
